# Hello, I'm Bimlesh Kumar Yadav! 👋

I’m currently serving as a **Laboratory Assistant in Biology** at *S.S. +2 High School, Mandu*, where I contribute to nurturing curiosity and scientific temperament among students.  

With a strong academic foundation as a **former BS-MS student in Chemistry at IISER Kolkata**, I combine my passion for science with a commitment to education and public service. Alongside my professional role, I am diligently **preparing for the UPSC Civil Services Examination (IAS)**, with the aim of contributing to society through knowledge, integrity, and service.

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>🌍 My Vision:</strong> To inspire young minds through science education today and serve society at large tomorrow through public administration.
